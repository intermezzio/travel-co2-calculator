# Setup for travel calculator

## Tasks

### Calculation

- Create a "calculation script" that takes in a route
and converts from (start, destination) to miles
with each mode of transportation
- Create a script that calls the database, converting
miles into a final CO2e number
- (Bonus!) Use some sort of web automation to get
CO2e per mile rates using non-REST APIs for the Shippy
challenge (does this mean web scraping counts?)

### User Data

- Populate a database for different people and their
car mileage and other necessary information
(CockroachDB?)
- Design a frontend for creating accounts and inputting
or updating information

### Google Maps

- Create a browser extension that can access data on websites
- Extract route information from a Google Maps page
